        The Add Cast and Add Background forms are seperate from the main 
        Callsheet form below and allow each cast member or BG item to be added individually.
        They may be used here before submitting it or on the Edit page. 
        <br /> 
        The schedule is provided to facilitate this and to view other Scene 
        information like Department Info. The Add Cast and BG forms can 
        also be viewed beside the Schedule. <br />
        The Callsheet is divided into FIVE sections: TIMES, INFO, 
        LOCATIONS, WALKIES and CREW CALLS.  </p>
